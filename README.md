This portfolio contains projects I'm developing during my journey of self-learning multiple software associated with data analytics and data science.

The SQL_Projects folder includes two projects on SQL. One on data exploration and one on data cleaning.

The Python_Projects folder includes mini projects which I created in order to become familiar with Python syntax. 
In another portfolio, is available material from a LinkedIn tutorial on data science with Python, which I followed along.

The optimization folder contains optimization programs developed in Python to solve decision making problems. For now I'm exploring solutions for the TSP problem, including greedy methods such as nearest neighbro heuristics, exact methods such as branch and bound algorithm or approximation algorithms such as simulated annealing. 

Soon I will update this portfolio with 
1) projects on data exploration, manipulation and cleaning on Python
2) mini-projects on machine learning using Scikit-learn and TensorFlow.

Stay tuned.
