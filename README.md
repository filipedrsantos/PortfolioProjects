This portfolio contains projects I'm developing during my journey of self-learning multiple software associated with data analytics and data science.

The SQL_Projects folder includes one project on data exploration and one project on data cleaning.

The Python_Projects folder includes mini projects which I created in order to become familiar with the syntax. In the other portfolio, material related to some LinkedIn tutorials on python, which I followed along, are given.

This portfolio will be updated possibly with some projects in Power BI, Tableau and Excel. 

I expect also to explore, in the near future, data analyses in python, using Pandas.

Besides data analytics I'm also interested in data science, and topics such as artificial intelligence, namely in the field of machine learning. 
I already learned some basics of machine learning and expect to present soon a project in Python + Scikit-learn and TensorFlow.

Stay tuned.
