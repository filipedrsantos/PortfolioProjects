This portfolio contains projects I'm developing during my journey of learning concepts and tools related to data analytics and data science.

The SQL_Projects folder includes two projects on SQL. One on data exploration and one on data cleaning.

The Python_Projects folder includes mini projects developed in order to become familiar with Python syntax. 
In another portfolio, is available material from a LinkedIn tutorial on data science with Python, which I followed along.

The optimization folder contains optimization programs developed in Python to solve decision making problems. For now, I'm exploring solutions for the TSP problem, including greedy techniques such as nearest neighbor heuristics, exact methods such as branch and bound algorithm or approximation algorithms such as simulated annealing.

The ML folder contains simple examples of application of supervised, both classification (k-nearest neighbors, naive Bayes, logistic regression, SVM, neural networks) and regression (linear regression and neural networks), and unsupervised (k-means clustering and PCA) machine learning methods, developed in python using libraries such as scikit-learn and TensorFlow

Soon I will update this portfolio with 
1) projects on data exploration, manipulation and cleaning on Python
2) examples of visualizations in excel, power bi and tableau

Stay tuned.
