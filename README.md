This portfolio contains projects I'm developing during my journey of self-learning multiple software associated with data analytics and data science.

The SQL_Projects folder includes one project on data exploration and one project on data cleaning.

The Python_Projects folder includes mini projects which I created in order to become familiar with the syntax. 
In another portfolio, material from a LinkedIn tutorial on data science with python, which I followed along, are given.

Soon I will update this portfolio with 
1) projects on data exploration, manipulation and cleaning on python
2) mini-projects on machine learning using Scikit-learn and TensorFlow.

Stay tuned.
