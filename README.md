This folder contains projects developed during my current journey of self-learning different software associated with data analytics, data science and data visualization.

The SQL projects folder includes a project on data exploration and another one on data cleaning.

The Python projects folder includes mini projects which I did for the purpose of learning syntax. In a separate portfolio, material for some of the LinkedIn python tutorials which I followed along, is given.

This portfolio will be updated possibly with some projects in Power BI, Tableau and Excel, which i am currently familiarizing with. I expect also to explore, in the near future, data analyses in python, using Pandas.

Besides data analytics I'm also interested in data science, and topics such as artificial intelligence, namely in the field of machine learning. 
I already learned some basics of machine learning and expect to present soon a project in python + TensorFlow.

Stay tuned.
